## What is Custom Channel Settings

There are many LLM providers in the market that offer free models, but usually with some usage limitations. This is a good choice for personal testing, but with so many providers, it becomes a challenge to connect them all together.

## How to use?

Our platform plans to launch **Custom Channel Settings**, which enables multi-platform model integration through simple configuration:

- Use **OpenAI-compatible** method to enter configuration parameters:
  - `base_url`
  - `api_key` 
  - `model_name`

- **Proxy forwarding** through our platform
- Your client only needs to configure our address to request free models from multiple platforms
- Support flexible switching between paid and free models

## Announcement

- This feature is **completely free**
- Personal users only need simple configuration to use
- During the early stages, permission must be obtained by **sending an email request**

> **Coming soon, stay tuned!**
