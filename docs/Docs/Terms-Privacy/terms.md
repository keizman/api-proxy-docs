Thank you for your interest in GPT API Proxy ("**GPT API Proxy**," "**we**," or "**us**") and our website ("**Site**"), along with our related websites, networks, applications, and other services provided by us (collectively, our "**Service**"). These Terms of Service are a legally binding contract between you and GPT API Proxy regarding your use of the Service.

> **IMPORTANT NOTICE:** BY CLICKING "I ACCEPT," OR BY USING THE SERVICE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE GPT API PROXY PRIVACY POLICY (TOGETHER, THE "**TERMS**"). If you are not eligible, or do not agree to the Terms, then you do not have our permission to use the Service.

## Arbitration Notice

**These Terms provide that all disputes between you and GPT API Proxy will be resolved by BINDING ARBITRATION.**

* YOU AGREE TO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights under this contract, except for matters that may be taken to small claims court. 
* Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury
* Your claims cannot be brought as a class action

Please review Section 17 ("Dispute Resolution and Arbitration") for the details regarding your agreement to arbitrate any disputes with GPT API Proxy.

## 1. **Service Overview**

GPT API Proxy operates a large language model aggregator where users may use the Site to access third-party application programming interfaces ("**APIs**") to use a variety of generative artificial intelligence models listed on the Site ("**AI Models**"). GPT API Proxy may add or remove AI Models from the Service at any time.

## 2. **Eligibility**

You must be at least 13 years of age to use the Service. By agreeing to these Terms, you represent and warrant to us that: (a) you are at least 13 years of age; (b) you have not previously been suspended or removed from the Service; and (c) your registration and your use of the Service is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. If you are under 18 years of age, you must have your parent or guardian’s permission to use the Service.

## 3. **Accounts and Registration**

To access most features of the Service, you must register for an account. When you register for an account, you may be required to provide us or our authentication platform with some information about yourself, such as your email address or other contact information. You agree that the information you provide to us is accurate and that you will keep it accurate and up-to-date at all times. When you register, you will be asked to provide a password. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, and you accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account. If you have reason to believe that your account is no longer secure, then you must immediately notify us.

## 4. **Payment**

### 4.1 Pre-Paid Credits; Refunds

<<<<<<< HEAD
Access to the Service, or to certain features of the Service, may require you to pay fees for pre-paid credits that are linked to your account (“Credits”), along with payment processing fees and transaction fees. Before you pay any fees, you will have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. Currently, GPT API Proxy requires users to purchase Credits to make API calls and access the Service, with a minimum and maximum purchase amount of $5 and $25,000 per transaction, respectively. Once purchased, refunds for unused Credits may be requested within twenty-four (24) hours from the time the transaction was processed. If no refund request is received within twenty-four (24) hours following the purchase, any unused Credits become non-refundable. To request a refund within the eligible period, you must email GPT API Proxy. The unused credit amount will be refunded to your payment method; the platform fees are non-refundable. Cryptocurrency payments are never refundable.

### 4.2 Credit Expiration; Auto Recharge

GPT API Proxy reserves the right to expire unused credits three hundred sixty-five (365) days after purchase. When purchasing Credits, you will have the option to automatically add Credits to your account by charging the payment method of your choosing when your available Credits are below a threshold amount you have set on your account (“**Auto Recharge**”). If you elect the Auto Recharge option, you authorize GPT API Proxy to automatically charge payments to your account. You may update or cancel Auto Recharge at any time through your account page.

### 4.3 Currency; Payment Processing

GPT API Proxy will charge the payment method you specify at the time of purchase. You authorize GPT API Proxy to charge all sums as described in these Terms, for the Service you select, to that payment method. GPT API Proxy accepts payment through our third-party payment processors. All payments made through Stripe are in U.S. dollars, and payments made through Coinbase are through your crypto wallet. If you choose to pay using Coinbase, you represent and warrant that the cryptocurrency and source of funds for the cryptocurrency you use do not constitute the proceeds of a financial crime or any other crime under applicable law.

### 4.4 Changes to Fees
=======
Currently, users are required to purchase Credits (minimum $5, maximum $25,000 per transaction) to make API calls and access the Service, with associated payment processing and transaction fees disclosed before purchase. Refunds are conditional: a request must be submitted within twenty-four (24) hours of the transaction, AND the purchased Credits must be entirely unused. If either condition is not met (request outside the 24-hour window or any Credit usage), we cannot provide a refund. To request an eligible refund, please email refundg@planktonfly.com including the email address linked to your account. If approved, the Credit purchase amount will be refunded to your original payment method, excluding any non-refundable platform, processing, or transaction fees. Please note that payments made using cryptocurrency are non-refundable under any circumstances.

## 5. **User Content**

### 5.1 User Content Generally; Training Data.

You may provide input into the Services, which may include images, data, text, and other types of work (“**Input**”) and receive an output from the Services based on your Input (“**Output**”, and collectively, the Input and Output are “**User Content**”). You retain copyright and any other proprietary rights that you may hold in the Input. Your ownership rights in the Output are set forth in terms for each AI Model you use (“**AI Model Terms**”). Some AI Models may store or train on your Inputs for improving their own large language models and may allow you to opt-out of model training, as described in their AI Model Terms. Where possible, GPT API Proxy has opted out of model training with the AI Models it uses. GPT API Proxy strives to accurately represent the status of prompt logging and training for each AI Model on our Site. However, GPT API Proxy is not liable for errors or misrepresentations made in any AI Model Terms. You are encouraged to review AI Model Terms yourself as needed.

### 5.2 Opt-In License for Prompt Logging.

If you have opted into prompt logging in your account settings, you grant GPT API Proxy a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid right and license (with the right to sublicense) to host, store, transfer, display, perform, reproduce, modify for the purpose of formatting for display, adapt, translate, and prepare derivative works of, and distribute your User Content, in whole or in part, in any media formats and through any media channels now known or hereafter developed, for purposes of providing the Services to you and for our own commercial and business purposes.

### 5.3 Opt-In License for Chat Logging.

If you have opted into chat logging in your account settings, you grant GPT API Proxy a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid right and license (with the right to sublicense) to host, store, transfer, display, perform, reproduce, modify for the purpose of formatting for display, adapt, translate, and prepare derivative works of, and distribute any User Content submitted by you or produced by your use of our chat feature (which includes text, files and/or images), in whole or in part, in any media formats and through any media channels now known or hereafter developed, for purposes of providing the Services to you and for our own commercial and business purposes.

### 5.4 License to Categorize Inputs.

GPT API Proxy uses a hosted model for categorizing Inputs, which does not store or log any Inputs provided to it. In using the Service, you grant to GPT API Proxy a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid right and license (with the right to sublicense) to use, host, reproduce, and prepare derivative works of, your Inputs in anonymized form, solely for tracking and sharing user metrics on the Site, such as for example, on our Rankings Page, on an ongoing basis. Unless explicitly opted in to prompt logging, we do not store your Inputs after categorizing them and do not associate the categorized Inputs with any specific user or organizational accounts.

### 5.5 Input Representations and Warranties.

You are solely responsible for your Inputs and the consequences of providing Inputs. By providing Inputs, you affirm, represent, and warrant that:

* you are the creator and owner of the Inputs, or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to authorize GPT API Proxy to use, reproduce, and distribute your Inputs as necessary to exercise the licenses granted by you in this section, in the manner contemplated by GPT API Proxy, the Service, and these Terms; and

* your Inputs, and the use of your Inputs as contemplated by these Terms, does not and will not: (i) infringe, violate, or misappropriate any third-party right, including any copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of publicity, or any other intellectual property or proprietary right; (ii) slander, defame, libel, or invade the right of privacy, publicity or other property rights of any other person; or (iii) cause GPT API Proxy to violate any law or regulation.

### 5.6 Input and User Content Disclaimer.

We are under no obligation to edit or control Inputs that you or other users post or publish, and will not be in any way responsible or liable for Inputs. GPT API Proxy may, however, at any time and without prior notice, screen, remove, edit, or block any Inputs that in our sole judgment violates these Terms or is otherwise objectionable or illegal. You agree to waive, and do waive, any legal or equitable right or remedy you have or may have against GPT API Proxy with respect to the Inputs. We expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with User Content. If notified by a user, content owner or AI Model that User Content allegedly does not conform to these Terms, we may investigate the allegation and elect to terminate your access to the Services, in our discretion. For clarity, GPT API Proxy does not permit copyright-infringing activities on the Service.

### 5.7 Location of Originating Requests.

We strive to accurately provide to the AI Models the country of your originating request when accessing the Site using APIs. However, due to limitations of currently available technology, it is not always possible to accurately represent your country of origin, and this limitation may affect your ability to use the Service. You understand and agree that GPT API Proxy is not responsible for any incorrect location reporting to the AI Models.

BY USING THE SERVICE YOU AGREE NOT TO:

1. use the Service for any illegal purpose, in violation of any local, state, national, or international law or in violation of any applicable AI Model Terms;

You may terminate your account at any time by contacting customer service. If you terminate your account, you remain obligated to pay all outstanding fees, if any, incurred prior to termination relating to your use of the Service.

## 16. **General**

These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly incorporated by reference into these Terms, are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and GPT API Proxy regarding your use of the Service. Except as expressly permitted above, these Terms may be amended only by a written agreement signed by authorized representatives of all parties to these Terms. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the interpretation of any provision. If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will remain in full force and effect. Upon termination of these Terms, Sections 2, 4, 5 and 9 through 19, along with the Privacy Policy and any other accompanying agreements, will survive.

## 17. **Dispute Resolution and Arbitration**

### 17.1 Generally.

In the interest of resolving disputes between you and GPT API Proxy in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and GPT API Proxy agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND GPT API PROXY ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.

### 17.2 Exceptions.

Despite the provisions of Section 17.1, nothing in these Terms will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.

### 17.3 Arbitrator.

Any arbitration between you and GPT API Proxy will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “**AAA Rules**”) of the American Arbitration Association (“**AAA**”), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting GPT API Proxy.

### 17.4 Notice; Process.

A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if such other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“**Notice**”). GPT API Proxy's address for Notice is: GPT API Proxy, Inc., 169 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10016, United States. The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“**Demand**”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or GPT API Proxy may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or GPT API Proxy must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, GPT API Proxy will pay you the highest of the following: (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by GPT API Proxy in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $1,000.

### 17.5 Fees.

If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, GPT API Proxy will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in New York, NY, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse GPT API Proxy for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

### 17.6 No Class Actions.

YOU AND GPT API PROXY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and GPT API Proxy agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.

### 17.7 Modifications to this Arbitration Provision.

If GPT API Proxy makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to GPT API Proxy's address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to GPT API Proxy's address for Notice, in which case your account with GPT API Proxy will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will survive.

### 17.8 Enforceability.

If Section 17.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 17 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 17 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 15 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms.

## 18. **Consent to Electronic Communications**

By using the Service, you consent to receiving certain electronic communications from us as further described in our Privacy Policy. Please read our Privacy Policy to learn more about our electronic communications practices. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing.
